				<h1> Hi, I am Anouk! </h1>
				<img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Anouk" class="img-circle">
				<p> The words hard worker, team player, empathic, loyal and hands-on describe me the best. I am always looking for new challenges and eager to learn new things. Therefore, a company with a challenging environment where new ideas are being appreciated will give me the opportunity to develop my capabilities to a higher level.  </p>

				<h2> International oriented </h2>	
				<p> Starting from the day I was born in England, an international desire and being surrounded by other cultures has been the leading thread throughout my professional and personal life and the motive for my choices. I am creative, can think outside the box and have an eye for detail in order to exceed customer expectations. </p>

			<div class="card-shadow">
				<h2> Strong Client Focus </h2>
				<p> Hospitality and creating customer experience has been the common theme throughout my education, during my Bachelor at the Hotel Management School Maastricht and my Master’s Degree in International Marketing at the EADA Business School in Barcelona. During my education and internship, I worked with different marketing tools and business cases to position brands, improve storytelling of a brand and create unique campaigns.  </p>

			<div class="card-shadow">
				<h2> Team Player </h2>
				<p> Within teams I act as a ‘spider in the web’, which I know from my own experiences, feedback and multiple personality tests I have done. As a people oriented and empathic person, I have strong communication skills, can easily adapt to a group and I am good in developing relationships both internally and externally. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="card-shadow">
				<h2> Tech Ambition </h2>
				<p> During my master International Marketing at the EADA Business School, I was given the opportunity to follow a Tech Business Track through Le Wagon in addition to my studies. These courses have learned me the basics of Product Design Prototyping (UX, UI), Web development (HTML, CSS) and Programming and APIs. These courses already gave me a glimpse behind the scenes of IT and from here I want to continue with that. </p>
